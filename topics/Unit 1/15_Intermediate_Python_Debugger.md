# Intro to Debuggers

## Vocab
Debugging: Process of identifying and removing errors
Debugger: A program that assist in detection of errors and helps to fix them.
Breakpoint: Intention pausing place
Watch: Any item of data or expression a dev wants to observe when debugging
Stepping Over: Exectugin a function call on the current line and pausing on the line after the function call. 
Stepping Into: While running a debugger, entering a function call on the current line of execution and pausing execution on the 1st line. 

## Debuggers in general
Allow us to pause program execution, examine the state of the program and resume or execute hte application line by line. 

## Break pts & stepping Thru Code
A breakpoint pauses the debugger. While paused the dev can examine the state of the vars in scope. We can create multiple breakpoints, which allows us to jump between different points in the program and inspecting the state of app at each point. 

## Watches
watch allows us to track a value that was never stored in a variable. 

## Debugging w/VSCode
