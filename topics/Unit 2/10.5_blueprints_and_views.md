# Blueprints and Views
from: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/views/

- What is a view function? Code you write to respond to requests to your application. 
- in Flask: patterns used to match incoming req URL to the 'view' that should handle it. 
  - The view return data that Flasked turned into an outgoing resp. 

## Creating a Blueprint
- Blueprints = organize a group of related views. 
- views registered in a blueprint
  - What does it meant to register a view??
    - Tell the app that it should use the endpoints from the blueprint for routing.
- blueprint then registered in the application when available in the factory function.
  - Whats a factory function? 
    - Function that creates an object. 

`bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')`
- blueprint named `auth` created.
- `__name__` tells the blueprint where it is defined
- `url_prefix` will be prepended to all URL's associated w/the bp. 

Import and register the blueprint from the factory using app.register_blueprint(). Place the new code at the end of the factory function before returning the app.

```python
def create_app():
    app = ...
    # existing code omitted

    from . import auth
    app.register_blueprint(auth.bp)

    return app
```
