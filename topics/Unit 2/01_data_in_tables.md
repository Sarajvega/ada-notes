# Data in Tables

## Vocab
- Record: A single set of related data
- Attribute: A property of a record. Can have mutliple.
- Reading: Getting the val of somethin

We use tables to represent data. They are made of rows and columns.

Labels for columns are **headers**. Each row beneath is a record that represents one entity. 

Columns = attributes. Eachcolumn = one attribute and one record.
Rows Are Easy to Add, Columns Are Hard to Change! 
- Adding and deleting rows is equivalent to adding and deleting records
- Adding and deleting columns is painful
  - When we add a column, we'll need to go through each row and fill it in with some value.
  - Deleting a column also means going through and modifying every record.
  - Modifying the data for hundreds or thousands of rows (or more!) is a lot of work!
