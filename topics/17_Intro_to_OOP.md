# Intro to OOP

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that says programmers should solve problems by defining instructions for a computer to follow.

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is a subset of imperative programming that focuses on how we arrange and operate on data.

## Vocab
- Object-oriented programming: paradigm based on objects which contain state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
- Object: A collection of structured data along with the operations that can be performed on that data. An object is one instance of a class.
- Class: A template or blueprint used to create objects of a specific data type.
- Instance: One particular object of a certain data type/class.
- State:  generic term for the data that an object "knows" at one point in time
- Attribute: A named property of a class. Attributes are used to keep track of state.
- Behavior: A generic term for what an object can "do."
- Method: A function that is defined inside of a class
