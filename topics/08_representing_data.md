*When to use lists*
- problem uses lists/array, mentions mult things that are similar, mentions order, mentions getting/using/comparing one out of many, using elements by position, adding removing items from lists, length of list. 
Strengths of Dicts:
- Kayval pairs, unordered, access values via keys. 
When to use dicts:
- tables mentioned, close raltionship between idea and details about idea, map/transalte, frequency mentioned, key/vals. 

# Data and JSON 
- Whats JSON: "JavaScript Object Notation" data-interchange format that holds objects/arrays/string/num/booleans/etc. parse/gen data that is comptabile across langs. Reps data as a combo of ordered lists of vals/arrays and name/value pairs "objects". 
- Why use JSON: when we need to read data from one piece of software (API) and API gives back in JSON format, send data to another software and don't know comptaible format.
